Just a fun experiment - using the camera to control a game (e.g. https://github.com/Psywerx/game-off-2012)
When you move left or right, the program generates key presses and mouse movements.

How to install:
    have Scala, possibly 2.10 in your path
    if you don't have a 64-bit linux and java, get the correct javacv jar
    sudo apt-get install libopencv-core2.3 libopencv-core-dev libavcodec53 libavcodec-dev libavformat53 libavformat-dev
    if it says you don't have opencv 2.4, you can do this horrible thing at your own risk:
        for aaa in /usr/lib/libopencv_*2.3; do sudo ln -s $aaa ${aaa%????}.2.4; done

How to use:
    ./run
    now your mouse should move left/right along with your movements,
    also left and right are pressed on the keyboard

Libraries used:
    JavaCV - http://code.google.com/p/javacv/
