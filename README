Just a fun experiment - using a camera to control apps and games.
When you move, the program generates key presses and/or mouse movements.
Tested on https://github.com/Psywerx/game-off-2012 and a few racing games.

How to install:
    Have Scala (possibly 2.10 or 2.11) in your path.
    
    Linux:
      If you don't have a 64-bit linux and java:
        get the correct javacv jar
        fix the classpath in ./run
      Install these: (Note: the cppjars from javacv might work too - didn't test)
        sudo apt-get install libopencv-core2.3 libopencv-core-dev libavcodec53 
        sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat53 libavformat-dev
      If you don't have opencv 2.4 packs, do this horrible thing at your own risk:
        for aaa in /usr/lib/libopencv_*2.3; do sudo ln -s $aaa ${aaa%????}.2.4; done
        It will break when you update/reinstall OpenCV, and is a very ugly hack
      Run ./run

    Windows:
      If you don't have a 64-bit windows and java:
        get the correct javacv jar
        fix the classpath in run.bat
      Get the cppjars from javacv downloads and add them to classpath in run.bat
        (I don't have the access to the system where I got it to work)
      Run run.bat

    If it works slow, decrease the edge variable, and/or try changing sensitivity.
    (sorry, too lazy to make these two into proper switches/files right now :))
