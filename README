Just a fun experiment - using a camera to control apps and games.
When you move, the program generates key presses and/or mouse movements.
Tested on https://github.com/Psywerx/game-off-2012 and a few racing games.

How to install:
    Have Scala (possibly 2.10) in your path.
    If you don't have a 64-bit linux and java, get the correct javacv jar.
    Install these:
      sudo apt-get install libopencv-core2.3 libopencv-core-dev libavcodec53 
      sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat53 libavformat-dev
    If you don't have opencv 2.4, do this horrible thing at your own risk:
      for aaa in /usr/lib/libopencv_*2.3; do sudo ln -s $aaa ${aaa%????}.2.4; done
    If it works slow, decrease edge variable, and try changing sensitivity.
    (sorry, too lazy to make these two into proper switches right now :))
